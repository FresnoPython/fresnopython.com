title: Code of Conduct

## Quick Version

Fresno.py is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate without discussion and pre-approval from Fresno.py organizers. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of Fresno.py organizers.

## Additional Details

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Fresno.py organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or temporary or permanent expulsion from the group.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Fresno.py organizers as soon as possible. They will address the issue as soon as they are able.
